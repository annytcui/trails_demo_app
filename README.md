# TRAILS Demo App

This is a demo app built with Ruby on Rails.

## Getting started

To get started with the app, make sure you have PostgreSQL installed.

First, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, set up the database:

```
$ rails db:setup
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```
